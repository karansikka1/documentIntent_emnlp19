The first pieces of the highway opened in the 1920s. Later, the route became entwined with the lore of California. Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline. Before that, in 2016, a large wildfire near Big Sur burned more than 130,000 acres.

John and Mary's son, the 10th Earl, took the family name of Bowes Lyon and established a new family crest.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nMore recently, Glamis castle served as the childhood home of Elizabeth Bowes Lyon (Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) and was birthplace of her daughter, Princess Margaret.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @maltese_rose_photography \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #modernoutdoors #tourism #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #master_shots #thisisscotland #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #scotshots #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #queenelizabeth #glamiscastle #shakespeare #royalfamily #castlesofscotland", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3ac8ab9ec785ca347b1c3b9bda0d7674/5C14377F/t51.2885-15/e35/36776522_866241026905195_947705708051169280_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTA0NjUxMTE1NDExNjM3MA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 4059}, {"id": "36924895_1921324474554267_9191284718438449152_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "provoke", "caption": "is milo yiannopolous taken from meninistpower follow my partners bathinginliberaltears patrioticnugget if you like my content follow me capitalismwins recommend my page to your friends god bless the support trump keep making america great thank you president trump", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["liberal", "trump", "abortionismurder", "rightwing", "americafirst", "prolife", "2ammendment", "conservative", "onlyrealvictims", "transgender", "libtards", "2a", "gay", "buildthewall", "nra", "maga", "republican", "trumptrain", "reelecttrumpcsusa", "patriot", "americastrong", "freedom", "progun", "democrat", "leftwing", "presidenttrump", "trump2020", "liberallogic", "familyvalues"], "orig_caption": "\u201cFeminism is cancer\u201d -

Similar in merit, Salonga protects several endemic endangered species and covers a significant part of the Congo Basin, the world\u2019s second-largest rainforest after the Amazon.

In \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d she scrutinizes what she calls the new ethnic group on the scene: straight white men.

She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d she said.

Consider arm wrestling. Steve Kaplan, president of the @walunderground, earnestly believes arm wrestling is the sport of the future. But it\u2019s also a sport of the past. The World\u2019s Strongest Man competition was a pillar of the so-called \u201ctrash sports\u201d craze in the 1970s. Now, tech powerhouses like Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are experimenting with sports rights. \u201cIt is the greatest time to be a sports fan in the history of the world,\u201d said Burke Magnus, the @espn executive in charge of programming. No matter how small or unpopular a league or team is, their games are probably streaming to fans somewhere, he said. To be sure, streaming services and the niche sports they show face plenty of significant challenges before they become a viable alternative to broadcast or cable TV. But Steve is an optimist. Arm wrestling was ready for a reboot, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\u201d @mattrothphoto took this photo of Matt Mask, left, competing against Marcio Barboza at the World Armwrestling League.

That the drink is an attention-grabbing orange certainly helps. At Aperol-adjacent events, it\u2019s not unusual to see friends posing for photos, clinking their spritzes in the sun. And they might even be wearing #Aperol accessories. The strategy seems to be working. According to Nielsen, Aperol sales have gone up 48% since last summer. The spike is in line with a rising demand in the U.S. for herbal bitter liqueurs, or amaro, more generally. \u201cThe Aperol spritz is here to stay,\u201d Melanie Batchelor said. \u201cIt plays into trends \u2014 Americans are starting to appreciate more bitter tastes and they want more drinks that are low in alcohol content.\u201d @karstenmoran took this photo of an #AperolSpritz.

As the Earls of Cassilis, the family prospered, with one member marrying a daughter of King Robert III, while another went on to become Bishop of St Andrews.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure has been noted in history on a number of occasions. In 1429 a meeting took place here between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell, however, did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1563 Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Dunure Castle as the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis. Gilbert was, however, not always so hospitable towards his guests. In September 1570, Dunure Castle was the scene of a gruesome event during which Gilbert Kennedy roasted alive the Commendator of Crossraguel, in order to force him to transfer to him some of the lands belonging to the Abbey. The Commendator yielded after two turns of the spit and survived his injuries.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure Castle has been in private hands since 1704 and by the middle of the century had fallen into disrepair.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @sharonwilsonphotography \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland  #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #lifeofadventure #master_shots #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #modernoutdoors #greatnorthcollective #travelblogger #abandonedplaces #ruins #abandoned_addiction #scotland_insta", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2c690fd8eca120acac17ec70ce4e4134/5BD0D651/t51.2885-15/e35/37067564_427634414406393_5758280619595399168_n.jpg?se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgyNTY2MjM0MDkyMjY1OTI1OQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 3386}, {"id": "34983660_212890242859326_5331334452029161472_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "bonjour", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["redpills", "daybyday", "morpheus"], "orig_caption": "Bonjour\n\n#daybyday #morpheus #redpills", "url": "https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/ea53904163604449e96f9713cfd58e3d/5BEA05C6/t51.2885-15/e35/34983660_212890242859326_5331334452029161472_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgwNTgzNzMwOTk0NjgwOTMyOQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 39}, {"id": "37123349_449813372152193_6151186499871178752_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "this clever pizza toast by alidaryder is practically the coolest thing since sliced bread in our humble opinion the more pizza recipes from thefeedfeedcompizza pizza feed edited by feedmedearly or if you ever want the recipe of a pic weve posted on this account go to thefeedfeedcominstagram link in profile tagging thefeedfeed for a chance to be featured here and on our site", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["foodstagram", "cheese", "foodie", "toasttuesday", "instafood", "recipe", "eats", "igfood", "feedfeed", "dinner", "pizzatime", "fatherday", "pizzalover", "pizza"], "orig_caption": "This clever Pizza Toast by @alidaryder is practically the coolest thing since sliced bread, in our humble opinion.\n\ud83d\udc49Get the #recipe & 50+ more Pizza recipes from thefeedfeed.com/pizza (Pizza Feed edited by @feedmedearly) or if you ever want the recipe of a pic we've posted on this account go to thefeedfeed.com/instagram (Link in Profile)\n\ud83c\udf1fKeep tagging \"#feedfeed @thefeedfeed\" for a chance to be featured here and on our site.\n.\n.\n#pizza #pizzalover #cheese #foodie #instafood #foodstagram #eats #igfood #pizzatime #fatherday #dinner #recipe #toasttuesday", "url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fd8ba66e8f1a12f8754c98618b2ba1f6/5BD79A78/t51.2885-15/e35/37123349_449813372152193_6151186499871178752_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyNTcyMjAwMjQ3NDczODAxNQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 8130}, {"id": "36889171_421982984967836_2705415086754758656_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "express", "caption": "please send prayers to the police officer that was shot last night suspect is in arrest but the officer is in critical condition from gun wounds he was shot around last night near mlk michigan ave and veronica shoemaker no words yet from his surgery but please keep him in your thoughts today", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["bluelinefamily", "thinblueline", "bluelives", "fmpd"], "orig_caption": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Please send prayers to the police officer that was shot last night.

Although the Stewarts of Appin were solidly behind Prince Charles, and raised a regiment of 300, the Castle was too strong for them to take.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe last Campbell was born in the Castle in 1775 and Campbells continued to reside in it until about 1800 when they built a new house on the mainland.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn about 1840 the roof either fell in or was perhaps removed to avoid roof-tax and the Castle was abandoned.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1908 the Castle was regained from the Campbells by Charles Stewart of Achara who purchased it and carried out some basic preservation work to stem its decay.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1947 his successor, Duncan Stewart, who was Governor of Sarawak, was murdered and the Castle devolved on his widow.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1965 Lt.

"In attempting to fight through enemy trenches, or to defend against attack, all armies came to rely heavily on grenades. These simple, hand-thrown weapons had been invented hundreds of years before, but had not been widely used since the Napoleonic era. Reinvented by the requirements of trench warfare, the first grenades in 1914 were often hand-made, consisting of old cans filled with nails and bits of metal and packed with gunpowder. They often proved as dangerous to their makers as to their intended targets, due to the risk of premature explosion.\n\nBy the end of 1915, all armies were being supplied with hand bombs. Rifle grenadiers fired specifically modified grenades from rifles, while the infantry on both sides carried dozens of different types. The Germans tended to prefer the stick bomb, which could be thrown farther but had a smaller explosive charge. The British and Canadians used egg-shaped hand grenades, which could be thrown about 30 metres (10 metres\u00a0fewer than the German sticks), but carried a larger explosive charge.\n\nBy 1917, all infantry carried grenades. All major assaults required attacking troops to carry extra grenades to capture their objectives and then hold them against enemy counterattack.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0d2f90c192fb2d88f858a9257bc9b7e/5BF2BED1/t51.2885-15/e35/36930914_666797756999951_56316684926976000_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxMzE5NTY5OTMyNDEyMg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 655}, {"id": "37624128_214215029238503_3888391445354119168_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "express", "caption": "jul nd small towns there is something cozy about little towns everyone says hi knows your name and is generally happy to see you today was spent in a number of these small fishery towns and it felt like home", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["ilovetravel", "travellingtheworld", "wonder", "discover", "smalltowns", "happiness", "sightseeing", "ilovesweden", "havefun", "travel", "traveller", "traveljunkie", "travelling", "passportaddict", "tack", "instatravel", "grow", "wanderer", "wonderlust", "sweden", "goingplaces", "gogogo", "happytravels"], "orig_caption": "Jul 22nd: SMALL TOWNS\nThere is something cozy about little towns, everyone says hi, knows your name and is generally happy to see you.

Located approximately 70 million light-years away, it\u2019s host to a particularly interesting exploded star, also known as a supernova.\n\nIn November 2008, 14-year-old Caroline Moore from New York discovered this supernova, which made her the youngest person at the time to have discovered one. Follow-up observations by professional astronomers showed that it was peculiarly interesting in many different ways. \nFirst, its host galaxy rarely produces supernovae. It is also one of the faintest supernovae ever observed and after the explosion it expanded very slowly, suggesting that the explosion did not release copious amounts of energy as usually expected. Astronomers have now classified it as a subclass of a Type Ia supernova, which is the explosion of a white dwarf that hungrily accretes matter from a companion star. It may have may have been the result of a partially failed supernova, explaining why the explosion failed to decimate the whole star.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble & NASA\n\n#nasa #space #hubble #spothubble #universe #solarsystem #galaxy #supernova #exploded #star #irregular #beautiful #lightyears #discovery #exploration #telescope #astronomy #explosion #pictureoftheday #science", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/277b6062dc8d9fe8cbf9effef24873f3/5BC948B4/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/36979133_250533269059330_8683397340968517632_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyMzQzNTU3ODkzOTc5NjA2Mg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 559144}, {"id": "37193291_1050680621766555_6028077777796726784_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "this book is incredible a couple chapters in highly recommend", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["metoo"], "orig_caption": "This book is incredible a couple chapters in.

The Norwegians dominated the north and west coasts of Scotland until the mid-13th century and Thurso, which was centrally located on the route from Norway to the Western isles, was chosen as a key residence to serve the Earls of Orkney and Caithness.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nBy the 17th century vast swathes of Caithness and Sutherland were under the control of the powerful Sinclair family. Around 1660 the 6th Earl of Caithness started work on a new castle. Work was overseen by Donald Ross and became George's primary residence. He was an important magnate in northern Scotland but found himself embroiled in a bitter land dispute with the Campbells of Glenorchy. Attempts to resolve the issue through the courts were followed by a decision by the King in favour of the Campbells. This prompted George Sinclair to mount a guerrilla campaign against his rivals.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThurso castle, along with other Sinclair properties were seized by the Campbells but then attacked and badly damaged by George's men. The dispute was eventually resolved following intervention by James, Duke of York (later James VII and II) and thereafter Thurso was repaired.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was substantially rebuilt in 1872 by Sir Tollemache Sinclair. The new structure took the form of a Scottish Baronial Gothic mansion. Large swathes of the 17th century castle were either demolished or incorporated into the new structure. The build quality of the new mansion was poor however and in 1952 much of the structure was demolished for safety reasons leaving just the sections visible today.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @venture_north\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #nc500 #thisisscotland #lifeofadventure #master_shots #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #modernoutdoors #greatnorthcollective #travelblogger #abandonedplaces #abandoned_addiction #northcoast #northeast #scottishhighlands", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7dc1b39a45d34d4f6734e57cade3686c/5C0FD710/t51.2885-15/e35/37119815_251831735602592_515332583018463232_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyNDczNTEzMzQ0MjQ3NTk3OA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 1657}, {"id": "36545835_197840454209798_780716168401911808_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "a vichy bikini so french regram nadiyabychkova r\u00e9f rachelle", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["Etam", "bikini", "Etamswim", "vintagestyle"], "orig_caption": "A vichy bikini ?

The initial crowdfunding has smashed its target for a giant balloon depicting mayor of London Sadiq Khan as a baby to fly above the streets of London next month in August. \nThe idea is a counter protest to Khan who authorised the baby Trump balloon to fly during President Trumps visit last week. It will also make up part of the 'MAKE LONDON SAFE AGAIN' campaign next month due to a DRAMATIC rise in crime throughout London since Sadiq Khan became Mayor with London now being the acid attack capital city of the world, soaring gun crimes, soaring knife crimes that has over taken New York. \nIn an interview before his arrival in the UK, the US President attacked Mr Khan saying he has \"done a very bad job on terrorism.\"\nMr Trump said: \"You have a mayor who has done a terrible job in London. He has done a terrible job. \nTake a look at the terrorism that he is taking place. Look at what is going on in London.\" Sadiq Khan is coming under increasing pressure from the backlash of the public to make London safe. In an interview, Khan stated that he would authorise the baby Sadiq Khan balloon so long as it was \"peaceful and safe\" just like baby Trump balloon. \nThe man behind the project, Yanny Bruere, states; \"I think it's insulting and childish. We shouldn't be making the US President feel unwelcome. Trump has made America safe and has made the world safe. In London, under Sadiq Khan as mayor, crime is soaring to unprecedented levels and people don\u2019t feel safe.\" [Access the crowdfunding page by clicking the link in Bio.] #feminism #feminist

The roof was removed after the war, and the building fell into disrepair.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @wilbo2222 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #abandoned_addiction #folkscenery #abandoned #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #dronestagram #thisisscotland #dronephotography #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #scotshots #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #abandonedplaces #ruins #master_shots", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bf492e680980f8f854d0f25f5514f940/5BD59C23/t51.2885-15/e35/37217663_226468514659961_4825042972737273856_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyNjQ0Mjk2MzU3NjkyNTMzNw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 4219}, {"id": "37313142_227060984588846_8188217865489350656_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "artist doing what we do best lnas gallery lnas local creators unfiltered", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["dallas", "gallery", "art", "colorfulart", "artist", "deepellum", "light", "abstractart", "ladiesnart", "theblackivy", "artistsoninstagram", "artvsartist", "popart", "dallasart", "nastywoman", "austinartist", "dallasartist", "love", "houstonartist", "support"], "orig_caption": "Artist doing what we do best!!

weekend means sitting in traffic hell for hours. But there are no roads in @lakeclarknps. Boats and planes are the only way in. @jennaschnuer took a 170-mile flight in a tiny Cessna 206 to get to the town of Port Alsworth. Lake Clark was declared a National Park in 1980 as part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. One of the goals: to protect the waters that flow into Bristol Bay, home to the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery. It would take many lifetimes to hike all of Lake Clark\u2019s glaciers, mountains, volcanoes and tundra; paddle all of the park\u2019s lakes and shoreline; and spot the wide range of wildlife large (bears, lynx, eagles and wolves) and small (collared pika and tundra shrew) that call the area home. The vast wilderness is 4 million acres \u2014 bigger than the state of Connecticut.

The main feature was a Tower House which was surrounded by a barmkin (curtain wall) enclosing the ancillary buildings such as brewhouse, bakehouse and stables. Sir Henry died in 1420 without leaving a male heir and his estates were subsequently divided between his daughters.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle passed through his second daughter, Marjorie, to her husband, Sir John Forbes. It would remain with his family for almost 300 years.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was rebuilt by William Forbes between 1584 and 1589. After his death Tolquhon Castle passed to his son, William. Further upgrades to the castle were planned but were never enacted nor were any additional modifications made by any of his successors although the surrounding gardens were re-landscaped in the late seventeenth century.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIt was during this period that the Forbes rose in prominence under the Stewart monarchs. Alexander Forbes had saved the life of Charles II during the Battle of Worcester (1651) and, after the Restoration of the monarchy, was knighted. The family remained loyal to the Stewarts even after the Glorious Revolution and accordingly the then owner, William Forbes, supported the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. Parliament declared his estates forfeit in 1716 but he refused to vacate and had to be forcibly evicted in September 1718.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle ceased to be a high status residence at this time and was eventually purchased by the Earl of Aberdeen to use as a farm house. It continued in this role until the early nineteenth century and thereafter was allowed to drift into ruin.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @braw_pics \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #folkscenery #scotland_greatshots #master_shots #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #travelphotography #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #abandonedplaces #abandoned #abandoned_excellence #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #lovegreatbritain", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f298df387486843bfae12f1ec5ed720c/5BD00505/t51.2885-15/e35/36717185_544295035985265_7331141692575186944_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTI2NTY4MDkzNTk1OTQ3Mw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 2162}, {"id": "28763906_1032674976880979_2130826119853637632_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "spotted in las vegas nevada directly from the portrait studio watch story to see how these billboards came to life in minutes and click the link in our profile to learn more about put smart to", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["Think2018"], "orig_caption": "\ud83d\udc40 Spotted in Las Vegas, Nevada.

A new model finds the oceans actually formed concurrently, or even hundreds of millions of years before, its volcanic system. According to Dr. Michael Manga of UC Berkley, \u201cWe're saying that the oceans predate and accompany the lava outpourings that made Tharsis....Eruptions triggered by the volcanic system also created channels that allowed underground water to reach the surface and fill the northern plains.\" So do you think there were once Martians and do you think they ever surfed? #mars #oceans #science \ud83d\udcf7 M.

It's disgusting to see rich people spend what would be someone's annual salary on purses when some of us can't afford food, housing, and other basic needs. You shouldn't be allowed to have more than one house when there are hundreds of thousands of people living on the streets. The spectacle of wealth on Instagram alone is appalling. I try to ignore it, but this shit comes up in my \"Explore\" all the damn time. I've even blocked some celebrities. Equity is nowhere in this damn country. You as an actor/actress, high paid musician/artist, or athlete do not work harder than plumbers, wait staff, or cleaners. If we want to be truly radical, we would destroy capitalism in favor of communism, y'all. (And before people are all, \"OMG communism \ud83d\ude31! Why not socialism?\" In short, Socialism is an economic system while communism is both an economic and political system. Socialism allows capitalism to exist in its midst while communism seeks to get rid of capitalism, and that's what we truly need). I'm just real tired of the bullshit.

After a lot of talk about the future, (planning a wedding gets you talking about a lot of things that aren\u2019t the wedding \ud83d\ude02), we decided it was time to make a move. Literally. I\u2019ve taken a job doing travel Speech Therapy, so that Bean and I can explore the country in a new state and city every 3 months and live a life that is more in tune with ourselves and the planet! This is a back up plan, as I really just wanted to live in a van and travel. But this seems more responsible... for now \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09We sold our 2000 era Honda Accords and traded up for a gently used Toyota RAV4  whom we\u2019ve Named Simon\ud83d\ude99. We moved our big furniture into storage and kept only what Simon could hold. Including our awesome golden doodle, Hazel Mae. We\u2019re excited to explore  as many US national parks and forests as possible in these next few months.... We are definitely sad to leave Columbus\u2014 it\u2019s been our home for 2+ years, and Home to so many wonderful people we are lucky to call our friends.

For the longest time I used to think the same way, but an aesthetically pleasing body is not a body that looks malnourished/weak(at least for me it isn\u2019t ). The number on the scale became irrelevant to my goals. I came to realize that it is pointless to have shredded abs and vascularity if I wasn\u2019t able to run 10+ miles on any given day, bench press my weight with ease, or get my chin over that bar 20 times. So girls, focus on how fast/far you can run, how heavy you can lift, how many pull-ups/pushups you can do. Performance trumps aesthetics every time. Create a body that\u2019s a furnace \ud83d\udd25, the best part about that is that it doesn\u2019t require constant regulation of your weight, macros, and calories. Create a metabolism that\u2019s so hyped up that you don\u2019t have to worry about how many carne asada tacos you had for lunch or whether you should get dessert or not.

It stands at the northern end of Sinclair Bay and was one of three fortifications that controlled this territory (the others were Ackergill Castle and Girnigoe Castle).\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe first record of the castle dates from 1623 when George defied King James VI (I of England). In response the King dispatched Sir Robert Gordon to raid Caithness and, although the rebellious Earl provisioned his castles for a siege, he withdrew to Orkney. All three castles surrendered without a fight to Sir Robert but were eventually returned to the Earl's son - George, Lord Berriedale.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1643 the castle passed to George Sinclair, Sixth Earl of Caithness. He built Thurso Castle which he used as his main residence with Keiss being allowed to decay. This was only exacerbated when the Sinclairs found themselves embroiled in a bitter dispute over land and title with the Campbells of Glenorchy. First the courts, then the King supported the latter, prompting Sinclair to mount a protracted guerrilla campaign against his rivals.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIt was only intervention by James, Duke of York (later James VII and II) that the Sinclairs were restored. By this time, Keiss Castle itself was ruinous although some repairs were made over the following decades for some form of dwelling.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @glebovaanastasia \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #greatnorthcollective  #thegreatoutdoors #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #master_shots #thisisscotland #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #caithness #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #scotlandsbeauty #scotlandlover #gameofthrones #abandonedplaces #castlesofscotland #nc500 #coastal", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d436f7f5e0d48d3727df7a9b657a94b1/5BF148A0/t51.2885-15/e35/36907751_1875746415817816_4999908172442370048_n.jpg?se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgyNzg5MzI0NjI2NTgyNzM5Mg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 5206}, {"id": "37109138_227976581189420_2486105737269346304_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "provoke", "caption": "communism supposed to be cute its not bloody cute its dr jordan peterson", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["FreeThinking", "america", "presidentdonaldtrump", "BigGovernment", "ThoughtPolice", "Trump2020", "politics", "deplorables", "draintheswamp", "communism", "constitution", "usa", "Government", "trumptrain", "conservative", "Lockherup", "Patriot", "makeamericagreatagain", "president", "maga", "republican", "true", "AltRight", "donaldtrump", "Trump", "buildthatwall", "capitalism", "Libertarian", "potus", "presidenttrump"], "orig_caption": "\u201cIs [communism] supposed to be cute?

Decrease the load you have on the bar and start working on the unilateral pattern.

Heat is already making the poor poorer and sicker. There\u2019s the Kolkata street vendor who squats from fatigue and nausea, the woman who passes out from heatstroke while selling water to tourists in Delhi and the people in emergency rooms with fever and headaches. A recent analysis of climate trends in several of South Asia\u2019s biggest cities found that if current warming trends continued, by the end of the century, wet bulb temperatures \u2014 a measure of heat and humidity that can indicate the point when the body can no longer cool itself \u2014 would be so high that people directly exposed for 6 hours or more wouldn\u2019t survive. In Delhi, @khandelwal_saumya photographed Kripa Devi, a water and lemonade vendor who struggles with the heat and says she regularly falls ill. The city\u2019s heat index has risen sharply \u2014 by 0.6 degrees Celsius in summer and 0.55 degrees during monsoons per decade between 1951 and 2010, according to one analysis.

Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.\u201d The lights can be found above the magnetic poles in the Northern Hemisphere, where is it called \u2018Aurora borealis\u2019 and in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is \u2018Aurora australis.\u2019 #amazing #auroraborealis #northernlights #science", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/341bd64f5cd53144ed597246b7df1a0c/5BED24B4/t51.2885-15/e15/36569303_2108170762788160_7608555004613361664_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyMjcwMjc1MDE3OTE2OTMwOA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 12002}, {"id": "36149024_2203480256540269_7745672548502732800_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "ouuu snap follow thefightforrights for more", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["girlpower", "prochoice", "whisper", "nastywoman", "bodypositive", "selflove", "catcalling", "feminist", "endcatcalling", "lgbtqcommunity", "sisterhood", "feminism", "equalrights", "dumptrump", "gay", "fightforrights", "endracism", "lgbtq", "endgunviolence", "lgbt", "catcallingisnotacompliment", "blacklivesmatter", "news", "empowerment", "equality", "girlgang", "guncontrol"], "orig_caption": "Ouuu snap \ud83d\ude02\nFollow @the_fight_for_rights  for more!\n#prochoice #feminism #feminist #sisterhood #nastywoman #dumptrump #selflove #equality #endgunviolence #guncontrol #endgunviolence #news #whisper #endcatcalling #catcallingisnotacompliment #catcalling #equality #equalrights #fightforrights #empowerment #girlgang #blacklivesmatter #guncontrol #lgbt #lgbtq #gay #lgbtqcommunity #prochoice #girlpower #endracism #bodypositive", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9cf019b4e9b761726d06de4064a70259/5BD6B3F6/t51.2885-15/e35/36149024_2203480256540269_7745672548502732800_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyODE4MTY4NDQ1ODI0ODI2MA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 5181}, {"id": "37314135_1743913535722933_3518253843844431872_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "express", "caption": "mood via", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["girlpower", "womenempoweringwomen", "celebratewomen", "strongwoman", "strongwomen", "smashthepatriarchy", "shero", "nastywoman", "nastywomen", "girlssupportinggirls", "feministart", "womensupportingwomen", "worklikeagirl", "womensrights", "femalesarestrongashell", "feminists", "ladyboss", "independentwomen", "feminism", "awomansplaceisintheresistance", "thefutureisfemale", "independentwoman", "empoweredwomen", "bosslady", "femalepower", "feministartists", "sheroes", "feministasfuck", "bossbabe", "feministaf"], "orig_caption": "Mood \ud83d\udc84 (Via @cosmopolitan)\u2800\n.\u2800\n.\u2800\n.\u2800\n#strongwomen #girlpower #feminism #independentwoman #independentwomen #bossbabe #femalesarestrongashell  #womensupportingwomen #bosslady #ladyboss #worklikeagirl #strongwoman #awomansplaceisintheresistance #nastywoman #nastywomen #thefutureisfemale #smashthepatriarchy #feministaf #feministasfuck #feministart #feministartists #girlssupportinggirls #celebratewomen #womenempoweringwomen #femalepower #empoweredwomen #shero #sheroes #womensrights #feminists", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2965e4c9c9a0da92716d90ef5da32320/5BF257D5/t51.2885-15/e35/37314135_1743913535722933_3518253843844431872_n.jpg?se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTI5NDI1MjI2Nzc1NDU0MQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 26}, {"id": "37182265_204601653730920_9088560933353029632_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "express", "caption": "just because you personally wouldnt get an abortion doesnt mean you should take away the choice for other women my body my choice", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["mybodymyrules", "prochoice", "keepyourlawsoffmybody", "mychoice", "womensrights"], "orig_caption": "Just because you personally wouldn't get an abortion doesn't mean you should take away the choice for other women.\nMy body, my choice. ~\ud83d\ude80\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n#prochoice #womensrights #mybodymyrules \n#mychoice \n#keepyourlawsoffmybody", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f98fed075fa460f5726f42810120104c/5C0F0C11/t51.2885-15/e35/37182265_204601653730920_9088560933353029632_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM2Mjg3NjExMzk2MDcwNA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 2}, {"id": "21688789_483004118738763_558873118924341248_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "promote", "caption": "so bad at keeping updated did this against me tattoo the other week thanks bailey", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["teenageanarchist", "tattoo", "art", "againstme"], "orig_caption": "So bad at keeping updated.

This is such a disheartening truth that compels us to find compensation. This \u201ccompensation\u201d also takes on many forms, most of which are other sins ironically enough. But the only remedy for our inability to hit the mark is Jesus Christ. Through his bloodshed, we have forgiveness. This changes everything. This integrates a spirit of redemption.

The Clan played a pivotal role in the history of the Highlands, from clan warfare to the Jacobite Rising, and the eventual breakdown of the traditional clan system.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nClan Donald came to Skye in the 15th century and held castles at Duntulm, Knock, Dunscaith, and Armadale. From around 1650 the clan chiefs began to stay at Armadale, and the mansion house later became a dower house for the widows of clan chiefs.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nPerhaps the most famous visitor to the old mansion house at Armadale was Flora MacDonald, known for her role in helping Bonnie Prince Charlie escape capture. She was married at Armadale Castle in 1750. Later visitors included Samuel Johnson and his biographer, James Boswell, who visited in 1773 as part of their famous journey through the Western Isles.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nA new mansion house was built in 1790 and extended in 1815 to form the present Armadale Castle. Unfortunately, the castle was gutted by fire in 1855. Most of the mansion was destroyed.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe central section was rebuilt, leaving the remainder a picturesque ruin. The MacDonald family moved to a smaller house on the estate in 1925, and today only the ruins of Armadale Castle remain.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @dianalou9 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #flower_igers #rivendell #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #thisisscotland #travelphotography #abandonedplaces #gameofthrones #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #lovegreatbritain #ruins #abandonedplaces #skye", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a8b177389011a8deba1026f8ea44aad8/5C139DF6/t51.2885-15/e35/36662160_207188133460869_6664911339191795712_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyNTMxMjM0NDgyNjQ0MzA4Ng%3D%3D.2", "likes": 4359}, {"id": "37001110_231014754402848_7014920851346685952_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "advocate", "caption": "reapproriating public space in la", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["wearethe99percent", "losangeles", "streetart", "fucktrump", "freedomnow", "ilovela", "antitrump", "streetpolitics"], "orig_caption": "Reapproriating public space in LA. #antitrump #fucktrump #streetart #freedomnow #losangeles #streetpolitics #ilovela #wearethe99percent", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0cf094fba2d4e615659947dbb66ed0ff/5BCF8321/t51.2885-15/e35/37001110_231014754402848_7014920851346685952_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM1ODYwMTQzMTE4NjQ3NQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 13}, {"id": "36148652_832103596975954_4175120928004374528_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "advocate", "caption": "if trump never became president america probably exist my backup account theyoungtrump my meme account theyoungtrumpmemes", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["republican", "trump", "godbless", "proudamerican", "godblesstheusa", "draintheswamp", "semperfi", "americafirst", "trumplicans", "keepamericagreat", "usa", "madeinamerica", "redwhiteandblue", "liberty", "conservative", "merica", "gop", "godblessamerica", "buildthewall", "makeamericagreatagain", "MAGA", "america", "trumptrain", "donaldtrump", "patriot", "freedom", "bluelivesmatter", "guns", "pence", "trump2020"], "orig_caption": "If Trump never became President, America probably wouldn\u2019t exist!\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n\ud83d\udd38Follow my backup account: @theyoungtrump1 \ud83d\udd38Follow my meme account: @theyoungtrumpmemes\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n#MAGA #makeamericagreatagain #americafirst #keepamericagreat #bluelivesmatter #buildthewall #draintheswamp #trump2020 #donaldtrump #trump #pence #trumptrain #trumplicans #republican #gop #conservative #godbless #godblessamerica #godblesstheusa #semperfi #usa #america #proudamerican #patriot #freedom #liberty #guns #madeinamerica #merica #redwhiteandblue", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/62a2a23a15398423406dda0b3d2111e3/5BE7ADB7/t51.2885-15/e35/36148652_832103596975954_4175120928004374528_n.jpg?efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJ1cmxnZW5fZnJvbV9pZyJ9&ig_cache_key=MTgxNzk0MDE1OTc4ODAxODgzOA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 695}, {"id": "33994934_2089929107950804_849244708071800832_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "express", "caption": "kate tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know pain or the burden they carry if you are struggling with depression and contemplating suicide please please seek help national suicide prevention lifeline", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "Kate Spade\u2019s tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know another\u2019s pain or the burden they carry.
