These simple, hand-thrown weapons had been invented hundreds of years before, but had not been widely used since the Napoleonic era. Reinvented by the requirements of trench warfare, the first grenades in 1914 were often hand-made, consisting of old cans filled with nails and bits of metal and packed with gunpowder. They often proved as dangerous to their makers as to their intended targets, due to the risk of premature explosion.\n\nBy the end of 1915, all armies were being supplied with hand bombs. Rifle grenadiers fired specifically modified grenades from rifles, while the infantry on both sides carried dozens of different types. The Germans tended to prefer the stick bomb, which could be thrown farther but had a smaller explosive charge. The British and Canadians used egg-shaped hand grenades, which could be thrown about 30 metres (10 metres\u00a0fewer than the German sticks), but carried a larger explosive charge.\n\nBy 1917, all infantry carried grenades. All major assaults required attacking troops to carry extra grenades to capture their objectives and then hold them against enemy counterattack.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0d2f90c192fb2d88f858a9257bc9b7e/5BF2BED1/t51.2885-15/e35/36930914_666797756999951_56316684926976000_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxMzE5NTY5OTMyNDEyMg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 655}, {"id": "37138792_661000007606843_3224137116229304320_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "totnes graffiti", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["brexit", "graffiti", "Totnes"], "orig_caption": "Totnes graffiti #Totnes #graffiti #brexit", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/01367b77c7c075f1e6f4eb36b30d4a83/5BE5FF37/t51.2885-15/e35/37138792_661000007606843_3224137116229304320_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM2Nzg2NjIwMjY2MTQ2MQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 4}, {"id": "37077711_423456244814680_4189896727899144192_n", "semiotic": "divergent", "intent": "expose", "caption": "even though of this town voted leave its still a pretty decent place to live", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["Summer", "Brexit", "HerneBay", "Vibesandthat"], "orig_caption": "Even though 90% of this town voted leave it's still a pretty decent place to live #Brexit #HerneBay #Summer #Vibesandthat", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c31c51ef1cde98645abf7e0c97c4fdcc/5BF20205/t51.2885-15/e35/37077711_423456244814680_4189896727899144192_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxNTkxMzc5OTgxODQ1MA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 7}, {"id": "36885182_251213522349791_5158221611865735168_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["fridaythe13th"], "orig_caption": "#fridaythe13th", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e790a3e379428ca33b8aa8181e5368e7/5C11C988/t51.2885-15/e35/36885182_251213522349791_5158221611865735168_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyMzAxMjg4OTQwNjEyNTMyNw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 5281}, {"id": "35355096_2095282807426602_2488737624508858368_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "inform", "caption": "a british soldier visits a comrades grave at sunset on the cliffs above cape helles gallipoli in be sure to follow us for more facts about wwi", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["Canada", "Turkey", "Italy", "worldwar1", "Scotland", "greatwar", "royalairforce", "battle", "soldiers", "raf", "death", "USA", "Austria", "trenches", "followme", "war", "ww1", "Roosevelt", "germany", "France", "Russia", "worldwar", "Churchill", "tank", "historiansunion", "guns", "Britain", "planes", "history"], "orig_caption": "A British soldier visits a comrade's grave at sunset on the cliffs above Cape Helles, Gallipoli in 1915.\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #raf #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/28fd5a0cb5a360a8dc46af8a92f60a6f/5BD821CB/t51.2885-15/e35/35355096_2095282807426602_2488737624508858368_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgxMDYyMTkzNzQ5NjYwMDMzNw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 390}, {"id": "36149391_232084944076103_5668288161252376576_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "when filled with make better for", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["Love", "PraiseGod", "Unconditional", "HappySunday", "selflove"], "orig_caption": "When you\u2019re filled with #selflove \u2014you make better choices\ud83c\udf3c\u2728 #HappySunday #PraiseGod for #Unconditional #Love", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9a95864b9c3177872c042bfb8765d5b8/5BD1DD4D/t51.2885-15/e35/36149391_232084944076103_5668288161252376576_n.jpg?efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJ1cmxnZW5fZnJvbV9pZyJ9&se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgxOTA5NDg3MTI4NDAxNTY5NQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 44}, {"id": "37232632_291584754743370_3367074426704101376_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "giving away free flags for the next hours click the link in my bio to claim yours comment what you won", "contextual": "close", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8FREE GIVEAWAY\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\u2022\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 We\u2019re giving away FREE FLAGS for the next 24 hours!

Four years later Sir John married Robert's daughter, Princess Joanna. It was their son, Sir John Lyon of Glamis, who began work on turning the old royal hunting lodge he had inherited into the Glamis Castle you see today.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe Lyons of Glamis nearly came unstuck over an argument in the early 1500s. As a child, James V was dominated, and later kidnapped, by his stepfather, Archibald Douglas. When James V gained power in 1528 he took his revenge on the whole of his stepfather's family.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nArchibald Douglas's sister, Janet Douglas, was the widow of John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis. James V brought charges of witchcraft against her, had her imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle and then, in 1537 had her burned at the stake. Janet\u2019s infant son was also condemned to death. Relations with the crown were later restored when Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Glamis Castle in 1562.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nJohn, the 5th Earl, supported the 1715 Jacobite uprising and was killed at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. A month later and before fleeing the country as the uprising collapsed, James VIII/III, stayed at Glamis Castle with 88 of his supporters. While there he is said to have healed a number of locals by touching them, a sign to the Jacobites that he was indeed the rightful king.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1767 John, the 9th Earl of Strathmore, married Mary Eleanor Bowes, heiress to the vast estates of her father, George Bowes. John and Mary's son, the 10th Earl, took the family name of Bowes Lyon and established a new family crest.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nMore recently, Glamis castle served as the childhood home of Elizabeth Bowes Lyon (Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) and was birthplace of her daughter, Princess Margaret.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @maltese_rose_photography

The initial crowdfunding has smashed its target for a giant balloon depicting mayor of London Sadiq Khan as a baby to fly above the streets of London next month in August. \nThe idea is a counter protest to Khan who authorised the baby Trump balloon to fly during President Trumps visit last week. It will also make up part of the 'MAKE LONDON SAFE AGAIN' campaign next month due to a DRAMATIC rise in crime throughout London since Sadiq Khan became Mayor with London now being the acid attack capital city of the world, soaring gun crimes, soaring knife crimes that has over taken New York. \nIn an interview before his arrival in the UK, the US President attacked Mr Khan saying he has \"done a very bad job on terrorism.\"\nMr Trump said: \"You have a mayor who has done a terrible job in London. He has done a terrible job. \nTake a look at the terrorism that he is taking place. Look at what is going on in London.\" Sadiq Khan is coming under increasing pressure from the backlash of the public to make London safe. In an interview, Khan stated that he would authorise the baby Sadiq Khan balloon so long as it was \"peaceful and safe\" just like baby Trump balloon. \nThe man behind the project, Yanny Bruere, states; \"I think it's insulting and childish. We shouldn't be making the US President feel unwelcome. Trump has made America safe and has made the world safe. In London, under Sadiq Khan as mayor, crime is soaring to unprecedented levels and people don\u2019t feel safe.\" [Access the crowdfunding page by clicking the link in Bio.] #feminism #feminist

The Stewarts under Ardsheal refused to hand it over when it was then besieged by the Campbells for several months until Ardsheal was granted an honourable surrender in 1690.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nAt the time of the 1745 Rising, Castle Stalker was held by the Campbells with a Garrison of about 59 Government troops. Although the Stewarts of Appin were solidly behind Prince Charles, and raised a regiment of 300, the Castle was too strong for them to take.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe last Campbell was born in the Castle in 1775 and Campbells continued to reside in it until about 1800 when they built a new house on the mainland.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn about 1840 the roof either fell in or was perhaps removed to avoid roof-tax and the Castle was abandoned.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1908 the Castle was regained from the Campbells by Charles Stewart of Achara who purchased it and carried out some basic preservation work to stem its decay.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1947 his successor, Duncan Stewart, who was Governor of Sarawak, was murdered and the Castle devolved on his widow.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1965 Lt.
