I believe that one of the greatest truths is that life is not about you\u2026\n.\nWhen we understand that, we will experience a huge shift or \"breakthrough\" in life. When we get the focus off of ourselves and onto others, serving the Lord and helping His people, all of a sudden things look a lot brighter.\n.\nOne of the biggest tricks of the devil is to get you so focused on yourself that you can't even see anyone else. Then, if you do see them, you are more likely to compare, criticize or judge.\n.\nLet's remember today that we didn't wake up to be served by others, but to serve and to be a light.

Standing, from left to right: King Haakon VII of Norway, Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria, King Manuel II of Portugal, Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire, King George I of Greece and King Albert I of Belgium. Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, King-Emperor George V of the United Kingdom and King Frederick VIII of Denmark. Within the next decade, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Ferdinand's empires would engage in bloody warfare with the nations led by King Albert I and King George V. The war was also a family affair, as Kaiser Wilhelm II was a first cousin to King George V, and an uncle to King Albert I. Of the remaining monarchs pictured, over the next decade one would be assassinated (Greece), three would keep their nations neutral (Norway, Spain, and Denmark), and two would be forced out of power by revolutions.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts",

  "orig_caption": "Tantallon Castle was built in the mid 14th century by William, Earl of Douglas.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nOn the death of William in 1384, he left a legitimate heir, James, and an illegitimate son, George. James inherited the entire Douglas estates but he was killed at the Battle of Otterburn. The mother of the illegitimate George now sought to promote her son's claim. The Douglas family divided into two factions with James' heir - Archibald the Grim - leading the Black Douglases whilst George headed the Red Douglases. Tantallon Castle was held by the latter.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nGeorge died in 1403 and was followed by his son, William. William was a loyal supporter of James II and was used by the King as a gaoler for key opponents. On Royal orders William incarcerated Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles at Tantallon between 1429 and 1431. He later led the King's army at the Battle of Arkinholm (1455) where he decisively defeated the Black Douglases.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe family also frequently clashed with the Crown. It was besieged by both James IV and James V. The end came for Tantallon Castle in 1650. In September that year an English army under Oliver Cromwell had defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar and had subsequently overrun southern Scotland. A force of 91 men under Alexander Seton established their base at Tantallon Castle. Operating from this secure facility they launched attacks on the English supply lines which followed the coastal route back towards Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nUnsurprisingly the English were not willing to leave this garrison in their rear and General George Monck was tasked with reducing the castle. He commenced an artillery bombardment, smashing a breach and took the castle. The damage was so extensive the castle was never rebuilt.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @stjudes \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #northsea #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #master_shots #thisisscotland #berwick #folkscenery  #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #abandoned #ruins #gameofthrones #medieval #master_shots",
