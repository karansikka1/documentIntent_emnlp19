It stretches more than 650 miles and knits together all that encapsulates California in the American imagination: the Pacific Coast, the redwood forests, the automobile. For the first time in more than a year, California\u2019s Highway 1 \u2014 often called the Pacific Coast Highway \u2014 is open without interruption, after a chunk of it was wiped away in a massive landslide last year. The first pieces of the highway opened in the 1920s. Later, the route became entwined with the lore of California. Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline. Before that, in 2016, a large wildfire near Big Sur burned more than 130,000 acres. Our staff photographer @jimwilson125 took this photo of fog along the coastline yesterday near #BigSur. | There is no shortage of travel literature about a road trip up or down the Pacific Coast Highway.

Virunga, Africa\u2019s oldest national park, is one of the world\u2019s most biologically diverse areas and is home to over half of the global population of critically endangered mountain gorillas. Similar in merit, Salonga protects several endemic endangered species and covers a significant part of the Congo Basin, the world\u2019s second-largest rainforest after the Amazon. Allowing drilling in these parks produces nothing positive; large amounts of carbon dioxide will be released into the atmosphere; biodiversity in the area will be lost; endangered species will be put at significant risk; the livelihoods of thousands of traditional farmers and fishermen who rely on unpolluted lands and water will be in peril. #FollowMe at @CristinaMittermeier or more photography that helps mend the plight of our planet by sparking dialogues on conservation. #Wildlife #Endangered #Conservation #Gorilla #Oil #Nature",

  "orig_caption": "This month, Young Jean Lee will become the first Asian-American woman to have a play on Broadway when \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d which opens at the Hayes Theater on July 23. She has written plays about identity politics and identity crises in the lives of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, feminists and evangelicals. In \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d she scrutinizes what she calls the new ethnic group on the scene: straight white men. For so long simply the default humans, they now face all the indignities of life with a label. Her work is about wrongness: about being the wrong kind of man, woman, Asian; about saying the wrong thing; about getting other people wrong. What makes the new play so weird isn\u2019t what she adds but what she takes out. The main character barely speaks. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d she said. It gave her the language to understand the racism she encountered as a child growing up in small-town Washington State. But its rhetoric has curdled, she feels. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re good or you\u2019re evil; you\u2019re a queer woman of color or you\u2019re some version of entitled privileged person,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like compassion is very out right now. Curiosity is out. What\u2019s in is condemnation and punishment. Now is not the moment for nuance; people do not want it.\u201d @paolakudacki took this photo of #YoungJeanLee for @nytmag.

The only thing he has accomplished was cutting taxes for corporations and the richest 1% of Americans, which he is now going to pay for on the backs of the middle class, the poor, the sick and the elderly... by cutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\n\n#Repost @mercurial_era\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nTrump is a failure!

Steve Kaplan, president of the @walunderground, earnestly believes arm wrestling is the sport of the future. But it\u2019s also a sport of the past. The World\u2019s Strongest Man competition was a pillar of the so-called \u201ctrash sports\u201d craze in the 1970s. Now, tech powerhouses like Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are experimenting with sports rights. \u201cIt is the greatest time to be a sports fan in the history of the world,\u201d said Burke Magnus, the @espn executive in charge of programming. No matter how small or unpopular a league or team is, their games are probably streaming to fans somewhere, he said. To be sure, streaming services and the niche sports they show face plenty of significant challenges before they become a viable alternative to broadcast or cable TV. But Steve is an optimist. Arm wrestling was ready for a reboot, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\u201d @mattrothphoto took this photo of Matt Mask, left, competing against Marcio Barboza at the World Armwrestling League.

Defence was clearly foremost in the minds of the builders of Gylen Castle but this was not the only consideration. The castle was intended to impress and to act as a clear status symbol for its owner. Accordingly craftsmen were employed to create the Oriel window that still dominates the landward frontage as well as numerous Romanesque style carvings\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe MacDougalls still owned the castle upon the outbreak of the Wars of Three Kingdoms in the mid-seventeenth century. The clan were supporters of the Royalist cause and in 1647 a detachment of Covenanters besieged the castle. The duration of the siege is not known but it was long enough for (the lack of) water to become a significant problem for the garrison. Although a natural spring existed it was clearly insufficient.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nEver mindful of the fearful massacre at Dunaverty Castle in May 1647, the clansmen within the castle surrendered. This did not save them however and they were all massacred, save John MacDougall who was spared on the grounds he was just a child. Gylen was sacked and burnt.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nGylen Castle has remained a ruin ever since the Covenanter attack. The ruins became famous after being painted by the artist J.W.M Turner in 1831. The structure was stabilised by the Ministry of Works in the 1950s but it was under the auspices of Morag MacDougall that significant work was done on the structure aided by donations from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @orsayoban \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #travelphotography #neverstopexploring #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #master_shots #greatnorthcollective #restoration #oban #scotland_greatshots #folkscenery",

That the drink is an attention-grabbing orange certainly helps. At Aperol-adjacent events, it\u2019s not unusual to see friends posing for photos, clinking their spritzes in the sun. And they might even be wearing #Aperol accessories. The strategy seems to be working. According to Nielsen, Aperol sales have gone up 48% since last summer. The spike is in line with a rising demand in the U.S. for herbal bitter liqueurs, or amaro, more generally. \u201cThe Aperol spritz is here to stay,\u201d Melanie Batchelor said. \u201cIt plays into trends \u2014 Americans are starting to appreciate more bitter tastes and they want more drinks that are low in alcohol content.\u201d @karstenmoran took this photo of an #AperolSpritz.

  "orig_caption": "The origins of Dunure Castle most likely date back to the 1200s, when a stone keep was built on an outcrop overlooking the Firth of Clyde.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle once served as the main seat to the powerful Kennedy family. As the Earls of Cassilis, the family prospered, with one member marrying a daughter of King Robert III, while another went on to become Bishop of St Andrews.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure has been noted in history on a number of occasions. In 1429 a meeting took place here between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell, however, did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1563 Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Dunure Castle as the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis. Gilbert was, however, not always so hospitable towards his guests. In September 1570, Dunure Castle was the scene of a gruesome event during which Gilbert Kennedy roasted alive the Commendator of Crossraguel, in order to force him to transfer to him some of the lands belonging to the Abbey. The Commendator yielded after two turns of the spit and survived his injuries.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure Castle has been in private hands since 1704 and by the middle of the century had fallen into disrepair.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @sharonwilsonphotography \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland  #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #lifeofadventure #master_shots #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #modernoutdoors #greatnorthcollective #travelblogger #abandonedplaces #ruins #abandoned_addiction #scotland_insta",

The name was changed to 'Ecclesgreig' by the ancestral owners, the Forsyth-Grants, to avoid confusion with the village of St. Cyrus.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe extravagances of Ecclesgreig\u2019s interior were hard to maintain, and the family fell on financial hardship. Consequently the castle was vacated in the 1950s and part of the roof removed. Some of the castle was subsequently used as a grain store.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nEcclesgreig went on the market in 1989 and finally sold 10 years later to Farquhar Estates Limited. Longstanding hopes to turn the castle into the centrepiece of a holiday resort have yet to materialise.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle is also said to have been a stop off on Bram Stoker\u2019s travels through the North East as he sought inspiration for Dracula.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @burgenland.ffm \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland  #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #hauntedhouse #thisisscotland #abandoned_addiction #master_shots #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #dracula #hauntedmansion #restoration #folkscenery #scotland_greatshots #scotspirit",

  "orig_caption": "Tantallon Castle was built in the mid 14th century by William, Earl of Douglas.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nOn the death of William in 1384, he left a legitimate heir, James, and an illegitimate son, George. James inherited the entire Douglas estates but he was killed at the Battle of Otterburn. The mother of the illegitimate George now sought to promote her son's claim. The Douglas family divided into two factions with James' heir - Archibald the Grim - leading the Black Douglases whilst George headed the Red Douglases. Tantallon Castle was held by the latter.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nGeorge died in 1403 and was followed by his son, William. William was a loyal supporter of James II and was used by the King as a gaoler for key opponents. On Royal orders William incarcerated Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles at Tantallon between 1429 and 1431. He later led the King's army at the Battle of Arkinholm (1455) where he decisively defeated the Black Douglases.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe family also frequently clashed with the Crown. It was besieged by both James IV and James V. The end came for Tantallon Castle in 1650. In September that year an English army under Oliver Cromwell had defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar and had subsequently overrun southern Scotland. A force of 91 men under Alexander Seton established their base at Tantallon Castle. Operating from this secure facility they launched attacks on the English supply lines which followed the coastal route back towards Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nUnsurprisingly the English were not willing to leave this garrison in their rear and General George Monck was tasked with reducing the castle. He commenced an artillery bombardment, smashing a breach and took the castle. The damage was so extensive the castle was never rebuilt.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @stjudes \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #northsea #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #master_shots #thisisscotland #berwick #folkscenery  #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #abandoned #ruins #gameofthrones #medieval #master_shots",

Many bloody battles waged nearby, including Wallace\u2019s great victory over English forces at Stirling Bridge (1297) and Robert the Bruce\u2019s decisive defeat of Edward II at Bannockburn (1314).\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nRobert the Bruce had the castle\u2019s defences destroyed to prevent it falling into enemy hands again. It was not substantially rebuilt until 1336, when the English recaptured it. The castle finally fell back into Scottish hands in 1342.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nUntil the Union of the Crowns in 1603, almost every Scottish monarch had either lived in the castle, or been crowned or died here. As such many grand celebrations took place at Stirling, from the coronation of Mary Queen of Scots to the christening of her son and future King James VI and I.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nToday it remains a great symbol of Scottish independence and national pride.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @bryanmillarwalker \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #crag #dronestagram #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #dronephotography #thisisscotland #master_shots #scotspirit #folkscenery #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #modernoutdoors #stirling #stirlingcastle #fortress #visualsoflife #landscapephotography",

He most likely built the first castle on this site.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe Fifes of Strathbogie lost their lands and titles in 1314, after siding with the English at the Battle of Bannockburn. The victorious Robert the Bruce granted Strathbogie to a loyal supporter, Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nAround 1445, Alexander, 2nd Lord Gordon, was created Earl of Huntly and became the King's chief lieutenant in North East Scotland, responsible for fighting the Black Douglases.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nHowever, by the mid-16th century the wealth of the Earl of Huntly was starting to be seen as a threat. After the 4th Earl continued to hear the mass despite its ban by the Reformation Act (1560), a Royal army was sent north to deal with the earl. He died in an accident on his way to Edinburgh to answer for his actions but, not to be denied a court hearing, the Government put his embalmed corpse on trial for treason.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDespite the fate of the 4th Earl, the Gordons remained in control of the castle and also continued their support for the Catholic cause. George Gordon, Fifth Earl of Huntly supported the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots in the civil war of 1568. However, following the Earl\u2019s role in the Spanish Blanks plot, James VI took action, forcing the Earl to flee to France. The King and Earl were later reconciled in 1597, with George Gordon being created Marquis of Huntly.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was sufficiently intact to be used as a garrison for Government troops following the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion but thereafter it drifted into ruin. It was placed into State care in 1923.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @pinkrachelc\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #gameofthrones #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #scotland_insta #thisisscotland #travelphotography #abandonedplaces #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #palace #modernoutdoors #conservation #greatnorthcollective #castleruins",

Located approximately 70 million light-years away, it\u2019s host to a particularly interesting exploded star, also known as a supernova.\n\nIn November 2008, 14-year-old Caroline Moore from New York discovered this supernova, which made her the youngest person at the time to have discovered one. Follow-up observations by professional astronomers showed that it was peculiarly interesting in many different ways. \nFirst, its host galaxy rarely produces supernovae. It is also one of the faintest supernovae ever observed and after the explosion it expanded very slowly, suggesting that the explosion did not release copious amounts of energy as usually expected. Astronomers have now classified it as a subclass of a Type Ia supernova, which is the explosion of a white dwarf that hungrily accretes matter from a companion star. It may have may have been the result of a partially failed supernova, explaining why the explosion failed to decimate the whole star.\n\nCredit: ESA/Hubble & NASA\n\n#nasa #space #hubble #spothubble #universe #solarsystem #galaxy #supernova #exploded #star #irregular #beautiful #lightyears #discovery #exploration #telescope #astronomy #explosion #pictureoftheday #science",

  "orig_caption": "The first fortification at Thurso was raised by the Norwegians probably in the form of an earth and timber structure but little is known about it other than a record dated 1157. The Norwegians dominated the north and west coasts of Scotland until the mid-13th century and Thurso, which was centrally located on the route from Norway to the Western isles, was chosen as a key residence to serve the Earls of Orkney and Caithness.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nBy the 17th century vast swathes of Caithness and Sutherland were under the control of the powerful Sinclair family. Around 1660 the 6th Earl of Caithness started work on a new castle. Work was overseen by Donald Ross and became George's primary residence. He was an important magnate in northern Scotland but found himself embroiled in a bitter land dispute with the Campbells of Glenorchy. Attempts to resolve the issue through the courts were followed by a decision by the King in favour of the Campbells. This prompted George Sinclair to mount a guerrilla campaign against his rivals.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThurso castle, along with other Sinclair properties were seized by the Campbells but then attacked and badly damaged by George's men. The dispute was eventually resolved following intervention by James, Duke of York (later James VII and II) and thereafter Thurso was repaired.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was substantially rebuilt in 1872 by Sir Tollemache Sinclair. The new structure took the form of a Scottish Baronial Gothic mansion. Large swathes of the 17th century castle were either demolished or incorporated into the new structure. The build quality of the new mansion was poor however and in 1952 much of the structure was demolished for safety reasons leaving just the sections visible today.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @venture_north\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #nc500 #thisisscotland #lifeofadventure #master_shots #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #modernoutdoors #greatnorthcollective #travelblogger #abandonedplaces #abandoned_addiction #northcoast #northeast #scottishhighlands",

  "orig_caption": "Visiting a National Park on a holiday weekend means sitting in traffic hell for hours. But there are no roads in @lakeclarknps. Boats and planes are the only way in. @jennaschnuer took a 170-mile flight in a tiny Cessna 206 to get to the town of Port Alsworth. Lake Clark was declared a National Park in 1980 as part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. One of the goals: to protect the waters that flow into Bristol Bay, home to the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery. It would take many lifetimes to hike all of Lake Clark\u2019s glaciers, mountains, volcanoes and tundra; paddle all of the park\u2019s lakes and shoreline; and spot the wide range of wildlife large (bears, lynx, eagles and wolves) and small (collared pika and tundra shrew) that call the area home. The vast wilderness is 4 million acres \u2014 bigger than the state of Connecticut. All that space for about 23,000 visitors per year. @csmphotos took this photo from the eastern shores of Lake Clark. Visit the link in our profile to read more from @nytimestravel. #\u26fa\ufe0f",

The main feature was a Tower House which was surrounded by a barmkin (curtain wall) enclosing the ancillary buildings such as brewhouse, bakehouse and stables. Sir Henry died in 1420 without leaving a male heir and his estates were subsequently divided between his daughters.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle passed through his second daughter, Marjorie, to her husband, Sir John Forbes. It would remain with his family for almost 300 years.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was rebuilt by William Forbes between 1584 and 1589. After his death Tolquhon Castle passed to his son, William. Further upgrades to the castle were planned but were never enacted nor were any additional modifications made by any of his successors although the surrounding gardens were re-landscaped in the late seventeenth century.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIt was during this period that the Forbes rose in prominence under the Stewart monarchs. Alexander Forbes had saved the life of Charles II during the Battle of Worcester (1651) and, after the Restoration of the monarchy, was knighted. The family remained loyal to the Stewarts even after the Glorious Revolution and accordingly the then owner, William Forbes, supported the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. Parliament declared his estates forfeit in 1716 but he refused to vacate and had to be forcibly evicted in September 1718.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle ceased to be a high status residence at this time and was eventually purchased by the Earl of Aberdeen to use as a farm house. It continued in this role until the early nineteenth century and thereafter was allowed to drift into ruin.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @braw_pics \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #folkscenery #scotland_greatshots #master_shots #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #travelphotography #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #abandonedplaces #abandoned #abandoned_excellence #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #lovegreatbritain",

It was a beautiful day and I wanted to enjoy the weather with a walk. Little did I know that later in the evening, something would happen that would make me really upset. Something I knew was inevitable but still unexpected at the time. I picked this daisy yesterday because flowers in general make me happy - I was feeling happy. Daisies just so happen to be symbols of cleansing and new beginnings. It can\u2019t be a coincidence, in fact I refuse to believe it is. So, here\u2019s to new beginnings. I\u2019m sad, but also excited for what the future holds in store for me.

Recent evidence suggests oceans formed on the red planet\u2019s surface 300 million years earlier than first believed.

A new model finds the oceans actually formed concurrently, or even hundreds of millions of years before, its volcanic system.

A millionaire/billionaire does not work \"harder\" to earn their money than someone working a minimum wage job. Millionaires/billionaires have more resources, which gets them ahead of everyone else--that's it. It's disgusting to see rich people spend what would be someone's annual salary on purses when some of us can't afford food, housing, and other basic needs. You shouldn't be allowed to have more than one house when there are hundreds of thousands of people living on the streets. The spectacle of wealth on Instagram alone is appalling. I try to ignore it, but this shit comes up in my \"Explore\" all the damn time. I've even blocked some celebrities. Equity is nowhere in this damn country. You as an actor/actress, high paid musician/artist, or athlete do not work harder than plumbers, wait staff, or cleaners. If we want to be truly radical, we would destroy capitalism in favor of communism, y'all. (And before people are all, \"OMG communism \ud83d\ude31! Why not socialism?\" In short, Socialism is an economic system while communism is both an economic and political system. Socialism allows capitalism to exist in its midst while communism seeks to get rid of capitalism, and that's what we truly need). I'm just real tired of the bullshit. I'm tired of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. #destroycapitalism #socialism #communism #eattherich",

I don\u2019t know about you guys, but\u2014when I was in school\u2014I was most concerned with my classroom supplies, getting a new backpack, and what I was going to wear for the first week back to class. It\u2019s funny how we spend so much time prepping for our education, but very little time preparing our spirits for what it takes to be a Christian on and off campus. Any place you go becomes and mission field for God when you are an ambassador for Christ. That doesn\u2019t mean shouting scriptures at the top of your lungs when you walk down the hallway, but it does mean building up your faith and preparing yourself to be a witness in the midst of peer pressure, bullying, drama, and gossip. In my latest YouTube video, I talk about four ways to keep your walk with God strong on campus. Whether you\u2019re in middle school, high school, or college (or know someone who is), click on the link in my bio to watch. Share with anyone you think could benefit from this information it as well. Now it\u2019s your turn: what are some of the things that helped you keep your faith strong in school?

After a lot of talk about the future, (planning a wedding gets you talking about a lot of things that aren\u2019t the wedding \ud83d\ude02), we decided it was time to make a move. Literally. I\u2019ve taken a job doing travel Speech Therapy, so that Bean and I can explore the country in a new state and city every 3 months and live a life that is more in tune with ourselves and the planet! This is a back up plan, as I really just wanted to live in a van and travel. But this seems more responsible... for now \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09We sold our 2000 era Honda Accords and traded up for a gently used Toyota RAV4  whom we\u2019ve Named Simon\ud83d\ude99. We moved our big furniture into storage and kept only what Simon could hold. Including our awesome golden doodle, Hazel Mae. We\u2019re excited to explore  as many US national parks and forests as possible in these next few months.... We are definitely sad to leave Columbus\u2014 it\u2019s been our home for 2+ years, and Home to so many wonderful people we are lucky to call our friends. There is only one place that could have made us leave so quickly, and that is Lake Tahoe for our first stop! This page will be used to share our adventures on the road and off.

For the longest time I used to think the same way, but an aesthetically pleasing body is not a body that looks malnourished/weak(at least for me it isn\u2019t ). The number on the scale became irrelevant to my goals. I came to realize that it is pointless to have shredded abs and vascularity if I wasn\u2019t able to run 10+ miles on any given day, bench press my weight with ease, or get my chin over that bar 20 times. So girls, focus on how fast/far you can run, how heavy you can lift, how many pull-ups/pushups you can do. Performance trumps aesthetics every time. Create a body that\u2019s a furnace \ud83d\udd25, the best part about that is that it doesn\u2019t require constant regulation of your weight, macros, and calories. Create a metabolism that\u2019s so hyped up that you don\u2019t have to worry about how many carne asada tacos you had for lunch or whether you should get dessert or not. Remember that it\u2019s called body BUILDING for a reason. So stuff your pretty face, lift heavy weights, and build the shhhhh** out of that body. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#doyoueveneatbro #eatlikeaking #liftlikeabeast #consistencyiskey #fitpugmom #loveyourbody #eatyourdonuts #performanceiskey #bodybuilder #murves #5weeksout\ud83d\udc59 #allyearround #femalemarine #girlswholift #girlswhoeat #treatyoself #flexfriday",

It stands at the northern end of Sinclair Bay and was one of three fortifications that controlled this territory (the others were Ackergill Castle and Girnigoe Castle).\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe first record of the castle dates from 1623 when George defied King James VI (I of England). In response the King dispatched Sir Robert Gordon to raid Caithness and, although the rebellious Earl provisioned his castles for a siege, he withdrew to Orkney. All three castles surrendered without a fight to Sir Robert but were eventually returned to the Earl's son - George, Lord Berriedale.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1643 the castle passed to George Sinclair, Sixth Earl of Caithness. He built Thurso Castle which he used as his main residence with Keiss being allowed to decay. This was only exacerbated when the Sinclairs found themselves embroiled in a bitter dispute over land and title with the Campbells of Glenorchy. First the courts, then the King supported the latter, prompting Sinclair to mount a protracted guerrilla campaign against his rivals.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIt was only intervention by James, Duke of York (later James VII and II) that the Sinclairs were restored. By this time, Keiss Castle itself was ruinous although some repairs were made over the following decades for some form of dwelling.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @glebovaanastasia \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #greatnorthcollective  #thegreatoutdoors #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #master_shots #thisisscotland #scotspirit #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #caithness #visituk #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #scotlandsbeauty #scotlandlover #gameofthrones #abandonedplaces #castlesofscotland #nc500 #coastal",

This is basically the same for adding sets to a certain exercise: just add an extra set of however many reps you were doing on any given exercise.\n-\n\ud83d\udd18Lets say that now you it\u2019s been 2 months and you are bored with the same workout you\u2019ve been doing and you feel like the deadlift has become way too easy, you can use more difficult variations of it and what I mean by that is to further push your deadlift gains try using a more difficult exercise like a single leg deadlift. Decrease the load you have on the bar and start working on the unilateral pattern. Although you would have to sacrifice how much weight you use, in the long run you would eventually work your way up to that weight but on a harder variation and when you return to your standard deadlift you will have made tons of gains.\n-\n\ud83d\udd18progressive overload works for all exercises, if you aren\u2019t prepping for a physique competition, powerlifting meet, strongman event, NFL combine, etc... then you should never complain about why you absolutely need a squat rack, bench press, deadlift platform, or why you absolutely need to only add weight to the bar and can\u2019t just do more reps and sets. -\n\ud83d\udd18where there is a will there is a way\n\n#Fitspo\u00a0#Fitfam\u00a0#GirlsWhoLift \u00a0#GymLife #Legday #NoPainNoGain #FitLife #GetStrong #Workout #MondayMiles #ChestDay #SeenOnMyRun #TrainHard #Gains #Strengthtraining #Physiquefreak #Fitness\u00a0#Bodybuilding\u00a0#Yoga #CrossFit #FitFluential\u00a0#Fitnessfriday\u00a0#Flexfriday\u00a0\u00a0#Sundayrunday\u00a0\u00a0#Instarunners #Gym\u00a0#Movenourishbelieve #Squats",

Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, King-Emperor George V of the United Kingdom and King Frederick VIII of Denmark. Within the next decade, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Ferdinand's empires would engage in bloody warfare with the nations led by King Albert I and King George V. The war was also a family affair, as Kaiser Wilhelm II was a first cousin to King George V, and an uncle to King Albert I. Of the remaining monarchs pictured, over the next decade one would be assassinated (Greece), three would keep their nations neutral (Norway, Spain, and Denmark), and two would be forced out of power by revolutions.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts",

The first, \u201cEastside,\u201d was released this month, written with Ed Sheeran and featuring vocals from @iamhalsey and @thegr8khalid. This fall, Benny will release an official album, but he plans to continue adding songs to it after the fact, which will include other A-list cameos. By early next year, he said, he hopes to have grown the album (playlist?) to some 30 tracks. Not quite an electronic DJ-producer, Benny \u2014 who does not perform live \u2014 is part cheerleader, part social connector and part celebrity confidante.

Understandably enough, there are countless ways to miss. To come up short. Inadequacy. To overshoot. Overzealous. Hubris. Clouded by ambition. Or you could be just slightly off. A seemingly insignificant sin yet still dishonoring. Regardless, sin literally means missing the mark. So often, we miss the mark. This is such a disheartening truth that compels us to find compensation. This \u201ccompensation\u201d also takes on many forms, most of which are other sins ironically enough. But the only remedy for our inability to hit the mark is Jesus Christ. Through his bloodshed, we have forgiveness. This changes everything. This integrates a spirit of redemption. We can take refuge in him (Psalm 46:1). He renews our strength (Isaiah 40:31). He cleanses is from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). So, as you and I both repetitively miss the mark, let us turn to Jesus not as a last resort but as our first option. #summer #camp #archery #sports #instapic #fitspo #fit #sun #instagood #tb #like #followme #ministry #la #passion #joy #love #handlelife #summerbody #2018 #redemption #church #Jesus #believer #scripture #blessed #grateful #praiseGod",

The Clan played a pivotal role in the history of the Highlands, from clan warfare to the Jacobite Rising, and the eventual breakdown of the traditional clan system.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nClan Donald came to Skye in the 15th century and held castles at Duntulm, Knock, Dunscaith, and Armadale. From around 1650 the clan chiefs began to stay at Armadale, and the mansion house later became a dower house for the widows of clan chiefs.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nPerhaps the most famous visitor to the old mansion house at Armadale was Flora MacDonald, known for her role in helping Bonnie Prince Charlie escape capture. She was married at Armadale Castle in 1750. Later visitors included Samuel Johnson and his biographer, James Boswell, who visited in 1773 as part of their famous journey through the Western Isles.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nA new mansion house was built in 1790 and extended in 1815 to form the present Armadale Castle. Unfortunately, the castle was gutted by fire in 1855. Most of the mansion was destroyed.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe central section was rebuilt, leaving the remainder a picturesque ruin. The MacDonald family moved to a smaller house on the estate in 1925, and today only the ruins of Armadale Castle remain.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @dianalou9 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #flower_igers #rivendell #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #thisisscotland #travelphotography #abandonedplaces #gameofthrones #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #lovegreatbritain #ruins #abandonedplaces #skye",
